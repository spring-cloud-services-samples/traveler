= Circuit Breaker Dashboard sample

*Company* and *Agency* are example applications demonstrating the use of Circuit Breaker Dashboard for Pivotal Cloud Foundry. (For information on the Circuit Breaker Dashboard product, please http://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/circuit-breaker/[see the documentation].)

== Building and Deploying

. Build the two projects from the root (`traveler`) directory. If using Maven, run:
+
....
$ mvn package
....
+
If using Gradle, run `./gradlew build` (OS X, Linux) or `gradlew.bat build` (Windows).
+
....
$ ./gradlew build
....

. Run the deployment script (if you used Maven, link:scripts/deploy_mvn.sh[`scripts/deploy_mvn.sh`] or link:scripts/deploy_mvn.bat[`scripts/deploy_mvn.bat`]; if you used Gradle, link:scripts/deploy_gradle.sh[`scripts/deploy_gradle.sh`] or link:scripts/deploy_gradle.bat[`scripts/deploy_gradle.bat`]).
+
....
$ ./scripts/deploy_gradle.sh
....
+
The script will create Circuit Breaker Dashboard and Service Registry service instances and then push the applications and bind them to the appropriate services.

. When the script has finished, set the `TRUST_CERTS` environment variable to the API endpoint of your Elastic Runtime instance (as in `api.example.com`), then restage the applications so that the changes will take effect. Setting `TRUST_CERTS` causes Spring Cloud Services to add the the SSL certificate at the specfied API endpoint to the JVM's truststore, so that the client application can communicate with a Service Registry service instance even if your Elastic Runtime instance is using a self-signed SSL certificate (see the http://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/service-registry/writing-client-applications.html#self-signed-ssl-certificate[Service Registry documentation]).
+
....
$ cf set-env company TRUST_CERTS api.wise.com
Setting env variable 'TRUST_CERTS' to 'api.wise.com' for app company in org myorg / space development as user...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
$ cf restage company
....
+
....
$ cf set-env agency TRUST_CERTS api.wise.com
Setting env variable 'TRUST_CERTS' to 'api.wise.com' for app agency in org myorg / space development as user...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
$ cf restage agency
....
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, the Spring Cloud Services Starters for Service Registry causes all application endpoints to be secured by HTTP Basic authentication. For more information or if you wish to disable this, https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/service-registry/writing-client-applications.html#disable-http-basic-auth[see the documentation]. (HTTP Basic authentication is disabled in these sample applications.)
====

== Trying It Out

. Visit `[ROUTE]`, where `[ROUTE]` is the route bound to the Agency application. In the Agency application, the `getGuide()` method on the `TravelAgent` class will use the Service Registry to look up the Company application and get a guide name, which will be randomly selected from a pool of three.
+

+
You can simulate load on the Agency application by using `curl`.
+
....
$ while true; do curl http://agency.wise.com; done
....

. To see the circuit breaker in action, stop the Company application. (You can do this either from Pivotal Cloud Foundry Apps Manager or using the cf Command Line Interface tool.)
+
....
$ cf stop company
Stopping app company in org myorg / space development as user...
OK
....
+
The Agency application&#8217;s calls to the Company application will begin failing. Once the failure rate reaches a threshold, the Circuit Breaker Dashboard will trip the `getGuide()` breaker. The calls will fall back to the Agency application&#8217;s own `getBackupGuide()` method and return a static backup guide name while the circuit is open.
+

. Check the dashboard to see the breaker status. Alongside the graph, the dashboard shows the status of calls made to `getGuide()` in the last 10 seconds. Call counts are color-coded.
+

. Start the Company application again (using either Apps Manager or the cf CLI).
+
....
$ cf start company
Starting app company in org myorg / space development as user...

0 of 1 instances running, 1 starting
0 of 1 instances running, 1 starting
1 of 1 instances running

App started
....
+
After the Company application has started and re-registered with the Service Registry instance and after the registration has trickled down to the Agency application, the Circuit Breaker Dashboard will close the `getGuide()` circuit.
+
image::closed-circuit.png[link:docs/images/closed-circuit.png]
+
You should again see calls to the Company application going through.
